# ARCheckersAssistant
An app on the phone, which would help you make the next best move in checkers. This could be used either to learn the game, or just as a fun tool to use.

The basic idea on how it would work:

1. have a non-empty checkers board in front of you
2. scan it from the top using your phone
3. choose which side you want the app to help
4. the app sees the game-state and (probably using some kind of API) shows the user the best move possible

Notes:
To be able to see the state of the game, we would need to use OpenCV - while we are not familiar with this technology, but also the teacher wants more students to use it, so he encouraged it.
